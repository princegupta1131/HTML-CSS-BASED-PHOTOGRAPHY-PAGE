    <h2>Hi there.</h2>
    <h3>Hi, I'm Sagar Gupta! If you are here, you are probably curious to know more about me. I am a boy who likes to travel. I liked to travel so much that I ended up quitting a well paying corporate job at the start of 2018 for it<h3> It may sound absurd, but through the wonders of the internet/ I have been able to create a sustainable job in travel for myself since I enjoy making travel related videos on YouTube</h3><h3> So no points for guessing that I have a YouTube channel which is all about travel. I am somebody who loves adventure, new cultures, different experiences and all good things that one can learn outside of the comfort of our homes I want to experience all that this beautiful earth has for us humans and document it along the way and share it with the YOU.
