      <p class="w3-large">Hi Guys! Manali is one of my favourite places in Himachal! When I'm in Manali, there are certain things that I always cherish doing. On my recent visit, I was introduced to a few more activities that are now on my Manali to-do list. So, for the uninitiated, who have never visited this wonderland, I have penned down a list of things you can do, to enjoy a perfect day in Manali <span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"></span></p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">Maggi by the river!</h1>
	  <h5 class="w3-center">Sit by the river and chill your beverages or Eat MaggiTradition since 1889</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">The river water in Manali is icy cold for most part of the year as it melts down from snow clad mountain-tops. If you try dipping your feet in the waters, they may chill you too much for your comfort. However, you could plant your beverages in the river water, while you sit and wait for it to cool. Also, hog on some hot piping maggi from the nearby vendors. The scrumptious combination of Maggi and river chilled beverage is to die for I am unabashedly a wine lover, so I chilled a bottle of grape wine and sipped it along with my Maggi<span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"></span></p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">Rent a cycle!</h1>
	  <h5 class="w3-center"></h5>
      <p class="w3-large">If you are among those who think driving is too pass on mountain roads, especially because of how clogged the roads of Manali are these days (owing to traffic) go green this summer and rent a cycle! There are a ton of places you can rent a cycle from, like I rented mine from <a href="http://himalayanbackcountryadventures.com/">Himalayan Backcountry Adventures</a>. Do inspect your cycle for any adjustments you may need prior to renting and ask for a helmet to stay safe. Once you are done with the formalities, go  explore the great wilderness, the country side roads, apple orchards, Beas River, Vashist temple etc. For all you know, you may find hidden corners of the place that no body knows of.I am sure you will love the experience as much as I do. In the photo below I'm on Vashist Road

      <h1 class="w3-center">Eat Breakfast at World Peace Cafe</h1>
	  <h5 class="w3-center"></h5>
      <p class="w3-large">World Peach Cafe is a restaurant in Vashist on the way to Vashist temple. The view from this place is mesmerizing because of the vantage point it offers. Also, the food here is to die for. I tried some shrimp momos, which was a first for me. They also had great Aloo Paratha, Pan Cakes and Pasta! Visit this place for the view, the light wind that blows and the aroma of coffee it brings with it. See below for a sneak peak of the view! Though upon your visit, you shall like the place a 100 times better than the picture itself<span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"></span></p>
